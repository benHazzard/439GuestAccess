# 439GuestAccess
https://github.com/benHazzard/439GuestAccess.git

This program uses selenium to automate the guest WIFI sign up process when the previous sign up expires (seven days).  The need for this 
program derives from the issue of connecting entertainment devices(Xbox, Apple TV, etc) to the WIFI. My fellow students and I living in 439
College Street at the University of Vermont donâ€™t have any way to connect entertainment devices to the main WIFI, forcing us to 
use the guest network. Using this program students will receive a text message containing their username and password for the next week.
